It, however, _is_ entirely compatible with Jupyter notebooks.\n","\n","##Current issues with the code:\n","1. Layering of images is tricky, maybe a modification of the folium code will help. At this point, there are 2 separate image outputs, one using classification on the median image, and another on the entire imagecollection.\n","2. The dictionary for the Random Forest, which contains information such as out of bounds error as well as variable importance, cannot be displayed in a user friendly way yet. The information however is available and the output has been suppressed until a way to display it properly is found.\n","3. Need a way to display `ee.image` objects as histograms.
